                    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how Zaka Microfunds (“Zaka”) collects and uses the personal information you provide to Zaka through our Website (www.Zaka.org) or by other means. It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your personal information and how you can access and update this information. By accessing or using the Website, you signify that you have read this Privacy Policy, and you expressly consent to our collection, use, disclosure, storage and protection of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<li>1.    No sale of personal information.  Zaka will not rent or sell your personal information to third parties.</li>

<li>2.    Information you provide through the account creation and update process.  When you create an account on the Website, we collect basic information about you through the registration process – your name, email address, and a means to authenticate your account (for example, a password). You may also choose to provide additional information through the account creation and update process, such as the person who referred you to Zaka, your location (for example, city, state/province and country), a picture and your address. If you choose to access the Website through your Facebook account, you are creating an account with Zaka on the Website and you grant Zaka permission to access your basic Facebook information (including gender and birthday) and, with your express consent, to use other information about you from Facebook in accordance with the Facebook terms of use, our Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy. Services like Facebook Connect give you the option to post information about your activities on this Website to your profile page to share with others within your network. You can review and update the account information you provide to Zaka through the Website by logging into your account on the Website. We collect any additional information you choose to provide us when you update your account on the Website.</li>

<li>3.    Information displayed on your lender page.  When you register for an account on the Website, the default profile setting is to have a public lender profile on the Website and under this setting, a basic public lender page will automatically be created for you. The basic public lender page shows to the public your first name, area of residence (city, state/province and country), public lender page URL and the date on which you created an account on the Website.  If you have performed work for Zaka, information related to this work may be automatically included on your basic public lender page (for example, if you have been a Zaka fellow, your Zaka fellow blog posts). You may also choose to provide other information through the creation of a lender page (for example, your occupation, the reasons why you lend, a description of your work and your website). You can review and update the lender page information you provide to Zaka through the Website by logging into your account on the Website. You have the option of closing down your public lender profile on the Website by changing your lender page setting to anonymous at your discretion. If you have a public lender profile, once you begin to make Loans on the Website or utilize other features on the Website, your public lender page on the Website will automatically show information about your activity on the Website (as further described below).

<li>4.    Information collected and displayed about the Loans that you have made (“Loan Transactions”).  Zaka collects information on your Loan Transactions, individually (for example, amount of a Loan Transaction, recipient of a Loan, Loan location, Loan status) and in the aggregate (for example, number of Loan Transactions and the distribution of Loan Transactions by gender, country, sector and partner). If you have created an account on the Website and conducted Loan Transactions through your account, Zaka makes information on these Loan Transactions available to you on your private portfolio page on the Website. Except as noted in Section 10 below, Zaka will not disclose your personally identifiable Loan Transaction information to any third party without your consent (please note: having a public lender profile setting on the Website at the time of disclosure is considered consent for such disclosure). If you have a public lender profile, information on Loan Transactions conducted through your Account will be displayed on your public lender page. Zaka may further publicly display and disclose Loan Transaction information, either in a personally identifiable or anonymous manner (depending on your lender profile setting at the time of such display or disclosure), for example, as part of the latest activity of any Lending Team to which you may have attributed the Loan, as part of the current activity on the Website and as part of a historical visualization of activity on the Website. If you have created an account on the Website and conducted Loan Transactions through your account, you can review information for these Loan Transactions by logging into your account on the Website.

<li>5.    Information collected, displayed and used for other Website and Program features.  As you use additional features on the Website or otherwise participate in the Program, we may collect any additional information you choose to provide in order to facilitate the operation of these features on the Website or your participation in the Program. For example:

a.    Lending Teams.  If you join a Lending Team and you have a public lender profile, information about your Lending Team will be displayed on your public lender page (for example, Lending Team name and location, as well as the number of Loans made by the Lending Team). In turn, you will be displayed as a member of the Lending Team (and a captain of the Lending Team, if applicable) either in a personally identifiable or anonymous manner (depending on your lender profile setting). Information about the Loan Transactions that you have attributed to a Lending Team (individually and in the aggregate) also will be displayed as part of Loans made by that Lending Team. You can review your Lending Team information by logging into your account on the Website.

b.    Invitees.  The lending profile of persons who have accepted your invitations to create an account on the Website may be displayed on your lending page as accepted invitees. In turn, if you have accepted an invitation to create an account on the Website, your lending profile may be displayed as an accepted invitee on the lending page of the person who invited you. If you have created an account on the Website and invited persons using the Zaka invitation feature in your account, you can review your invite activity and your accepted invitee information by logging into your account on the Website.

c.    Zaka Cards.  If you purchase a Zaka Card gift product, we collect information about your purchase (for example, your name as purchaser, amount you spent, number of Zaka Cards purchased and purchase dates) and information about your recipient that you provide (for example, recipient name, email address and physical address). Zaka uses the information you provide in order to deliver the Zaka Card and contact the purchaser and/or the recipient with respect to the purchased items. We may automatically disclose to the purchaser of an electronic Zaka Card the redeeming lender profile and date of redemption of the electronic Zaka Card. If you have created an account on the Website and purchased Zaka Cards through your account, you can review your Zaka Card information by logging into your account on the Website.

d.    Comments and messages.  If you use interactive features on the Website to write a comment (for example, on a Zaka blog, message board or volunteer forum), Zaka will collect your name and your comment, and optionally, your location and Zaka may publicly display this information. If you use interactive features on the Website to write a message through Zaka’s lender messaging feature, Zaka will collect your message and information about your recipient that you provide in order to deliver your message to the recipient and make your message available for access by the recipient. You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. To request removal of your personal information from our blog or community forum, please contact us.  In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.

e.    Integrated third party features.  If you use features on the Website that are integrated with third party websites or services (for example, Twitter and Facebook) to share information about your activity on the Website (for example, information about recently completed Loan Transactions and whether you “like” Zaka) through the third party website or service, Zaka will share this information with the third party website or service and additional information, if any, that you choose to provide to Zaka in order to use these features (for example, your username for the third party website or service). However, Zaka reserves the right to withhold or withdraw information related to borrowers to the extent necessary to protect the privacy of borrowers. If you use interactive features on Zaka to indicate that you "recommend" a particular feature or listing on Zaka, that information will be collected and may be displayed on the Website and furthermore shared on any applicable third party websites and services to which you have authorized such information sharing.

f.    Donations.  Zaka collects information on any donations you make to Zaka (whether through the Website or offline) to communicate with you (for example, to provide donation confirmations) via your email address, physical address or through other means of contact that you have chosen to provide to Zaka.

g.    Customer service.  If you contact Zaka customer service, we will collect the information you provide (for example, your name, email address, physical address, phone number and question/comment) in order to contact you and address your question or comment.

h.    Applications.  If you submit an application to Zaka (for example, to be an employee, volunteer, borrower, trustee or field partner), we collect the information you submit (for example, name, phone number, resume, cover letter and position of interest) to assess the application and follow up with you on such submission.  If you are applying to be a Zaka fellow, we reserve the right to disclose your application information to our field partners in order to help evaluate your application and placement.

i.    Surveys and Promotions. From time-to-time, Zaka may provide you the opportunity to participate in promotions or surveys through the Website or through email. If you participate, we may request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in these surveys or promotions is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code and gender). We use this information to notify and award promotion winners, to monitor Website traffic, personalize the Website and Program and to send participants email newsletters. We may use third party service providers to conduct these surveys or promotions. We will not share the personally identifiable information you provide through a contest or survey with other third parties unless we give you prior notice and choice.

j.    Zaka API.  The Zaka API is a service Zaka provides to allow third parties to develop and offer applications, services and features using information from the Website and Program (“Third Party Applications”).  The Zaka API may share any information about you that you have chosen to share publicly on the Website (whether through your lender page settings or otherwise) (“Public Information”).  In addition, if you authorize a Third Party Application to use your non-public information from the Website or Program (for example, your contact information and the amount of your available Zaka Credit and outstanding loans) (“Non-Public Information”), you are giving Zaka permission to share your Non-Public Information to such Third Party Application.  Third Party Applications are not created or maintained by Zaka, but by third parties.  These third parties’ terms of service and privacy policies govern how your information is handled by them (whether you provide your information to these third parties directly or through the Zaka API) and not this Privacy Policy or the Zaka Terms of Use.  These third parties have agreed to the Zaka API Terms of Service or a separately negotiated agreement, which contain restrictions on the use of your information.  Despite these agreements, Zaka may not screen or audit any Third Party Application, and Zaka cannot guarantee that third parties will abide by these agreements.  Zaka gives no guarantees or warranties with respect to any Third Party Application and is not responsible for your use or inability to use any Third Party Application, including without limitation the content, accuracy, reliability or security of Third Party Applications or the privacy practices or other policies of third parties.  To revoke permissions that you have granted to a Third Party Application, you may revoke these permissions by logging into your account on the Website or by contacting Zaka. To report suspected misuse of information, please contact us.

<li>6.    Information from third parties.  Zaka collects your information from third parties to facilitate activities and transactions for the operation of the Website and Program, improve User experiences on the Website and in the Program and further Zaka’s mission.  Examples of information we receive from other sources include information from another User about whether you referred that User to Zaka, information from service providers about your use of the Website.  If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. Zaka stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email, offering the ability for you to easily remind your friend and tracking the success of our referral program. Your friend may contact us at contactus@Zaka.org to request that we remove this information from our database. You can import contacts from your Gmail, Yahoo! or other email account address book to invite them to become members of our site. We or our service providers collect the username and password for the email account from which you wish to import your contacts and we will only use it for that purpose. To understand the ways in which Zaka may disclose your information to our affiliates, service providers, agents and representatives, please see Section 10 (Disclosure to affiliates, service providers, agents and representatives) below of this Privacy Policy.</li>

<li>7.    Information from cookies and web beacons.  Cookies are small text files created by a website that store information on your computer, such as your preferences when visiting that website. Similar to many websites, if you have enabled cookies in your browser, Zaka, independently and through enabled third party tools and programs, collects certain technical information using cookies, such as the path of users to the Website, pages visited, originating IP address, browser type, browser language and the date and time of the user's visit. This information helps Zaka track trends and improve areas of the Website and Program, and are common analytics used by most websites. If you have disabled cookies, the Website may not work as it is intended because Zaka uses cookies when you sign in to keep track of your personal session. Web beacons are tiny graphics with a unique identifier that are similar in function to cookies but, instead of being stored on your computer, are embedded invisibly on web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. Web beacons are used to track the online movements of internet users. Zaka uses them to better understand User interaction and engagement with the Website and Program (including without limitation, in electronic Communications), such as by learning whether certain users have accessed the Website via links from other websites. Zaka can use this information to tailor its audience for advertisements promoting Zaka. You may set your browser preferences to opt out of the collection and use of this tracking information for ad targeting purposes. One way to set your preferences for what sites can or can't share tracking information with Zaka (or with other websites) is by using a service such as the one available at www.aboutads.info/choices.  Zaka also uses cookies for remarketing, by placing a cookie in your browser to signal that you've visited the Website.  This gives us the option to show you ads for Zaka when you visit other websites that host advertisements.  Zaka supports the Do Not Track preference available on most internet browsers.  When you have enabled the Do Not Track setting on your browser, Zaka's remarketing functionality will be disabled.  The use of cookies by third parties on the Website is for the purpose of making the Website easier to use and to enable certain features of the Website and is not covered by this Privacy Policy.  We do not have control over these cookies.

<li>8.    Electronic communications.  From time to time you will receive disclosures, notices, documents and information based on your account information, status or activity (collectively, "Communications") from Zaka (for example, confirmations of Loans you have made, confirmation receipts for donations you have made, statements or other information with respect to the amount of credit available in your Zaka account, confirmation of email address or password changes, or customer service inquiries regarding the status of or activity in your account). By creating an account with Zaka on the Website, you agree that all Communications from Zaka relating to your use of the Website and participation in the Program may be provided or made available to you electronically by e-mail or at the Website. To access the Communications electronically, you will need to use a computer with Internet Explorer 8.0 or above, Chrome 4.0 or above, Safari 4.0 or above, Opera 10.0 or above or Firefox internet browsers and with hardware capable of running these internet browsers. You may withdraw your consent to receive Communications electronically by contacting Zaka in the manner described below. However, if you withdraw your consent to receive Communications electronically from Zaka (other than for the optional emails described in Section 9 (Optional emails) below), Zaka will not have the ability to permit you to fund any additional Loans through your account on the Website. The withdrawal of your consent will not affect the legal validity and enforceability of electronic Communications provided by or on behalf of us in connection with any of your Loans that have not been fully repaid, or any electronic Communications provided by or on behalf of Zaka prior to the time you withdraw your consent. It is your responsibility to keep Zaka informed of any changes in your email address so that you continue to receive all Communications without interruption. By registering on the Website, you acknowledge that you can access the electronic Communications, and you consent to having all Communications provided or made available to you in electronic form and to participate in the Program electronically. We may also provide you with Communications through physical mail.  You may request a paper copy of any electronic notice from Zaka by sending an email to contactus@Zaka.org, including your name and the address to which you would like the paper copy sent.

<li>9.    Optional emails.  By default, you will receive the following types of emails from Zaka, but you can choose not to receive these emails through a preference on the My Account, Email Preferences section of the Website or in the email: Loan repayment notifications, auto lending notifications, Zaka news, Loan updates, lender messages and team messages. Zaka will not disclose your email address to our field partners, borrowers or lenders in any case.  Note that if you have a public lender profile, other Users can send you messages through the Website.

<li>10.    Disclosure to affiliates, service providers, agents and representatives.  We will disclose your personal information to third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy statement. Zaka's affiliates and service providers, agents and representatives of Zaka and its affiliates may be provided access to your personally identifiable information as part of, or incident to, their provision of services to Zaka (for example, processing Loan transactions, distributing Zaka emails and fulfilling physical Zaka Card orders). All such access shall be under appropriate confidentiality agreements and limited to use to provide services to Zaka to help Zaka further its mission.

<li>11.    Disclosure of non-personally identifiable data.  Zaka reserves the right to disclose information that does not directly identify you, for example, aggregated or anonymized data, for educational, informational or promotional purposes in furtherance of Zaka’s mission.

<li>12.    Legal disclosures.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Privacy Policy or the Terms of Use, you acknowledge, consent and agree that Zaka may disclose information in order to: (a) comply with applicable law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request; (b) protect the rights, property and safety of Zaka, Users and others, including intellectual property rights; and (c) enforce or apply our agreements and policies.

<li>13.    Use of your information.  In addition to the uses (including display and disclosure) of your information that we have described above in this Privacy Policy, Zaka uses your information that Zaka has collected as described above in this Privacy Policy in order to facilitate activities and transactions for the operation of the Website and Program, improve User experiences on the Website and in the Program (for example, to personalize the content provided to you on the Website and to enhance connections between lenders and between lenders and borrowers) and further Zaka’s mission. With your consent we may post a short profile along with your name in the Meet the Fellows area of the Website. If you want your profile removed please contact us.

<li>14.    Access to your information. If your personally identifiable information changes, you may correct, update, amend, delete/remove your information by making the change on the My Account, My Lender Page section of the Website or by requesting the change by contacting Zaka by email at contactus@Zaka.org or by postal mail at the contact information listed in Section 22 (How to contact Zaka) below. We will respond to your change request within 30 days. You may terminate your participation in the Program and registered account on the Website at any time and for any reason by sending a written notice of termination to Zaka along with instructions for the disposition of your then-available Zaka Credit and any additional credits that you may receive in the future (e.g., based on repayments of then-outstanding and active Loans), such notice to be effective within 3 days of receipt by Zaka.</li>

<li>15.    Links to other websites.  If you follow any links which remove you from the Website (for example, the independently operated ZakaStore.org and ZakaFriends.org, PayPal, Facebook, Twitter, Blogger, Wordpress, Salesforce and any websites that use data from our API, including joinfite.org), this Privacy Policy no longer applies – i.e., the privacy policies and practices of other websites and other parties are governed by their respective terms of use and privacy policies. Please note that electronic payment processing for (i) additions of funds into a Zaka account or (ii) withdrawal of funds from a Zaka account is provided by the third-party payment processing provider, PayPal.</li>

<li>16.    Public Forums. Our Website offers publicly accessible blogs or community forums. You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. To request removal of your personal information from our blog or community forum, contact us at contactus@Zaka.org.  In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.</li>

<li>17.    Note regarding children under 13.  The Website is intended to be used by adults. It is not intended for children, and Zaka does not want to collect any personal information for persons who are under the age of 13. Zaka recommends that parents do not post, or permit others to post, any personally identifiable information with respect to persons under the age of 13. If you believe that we have any information from a child under age 13, please contact us at contactus@Zaka.org.</li>

<li>18.    Security.  Zaka takes reasonable steps to maintain appropriate physical, technical such as encrypting transmission of information using SSL and administrative security to help prevent loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure and modification of personal information.  While we take these reasonable efforts to safeguard your personal information, no system or transmission of data over the Internet or any other public network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.</li>

<li>19.    Location of data.  Zaka is headquartered in the USA. Your personal information may be accessed by Zaka, our affiliates, service providers, agents and representatives in the USA or elsewhere in the world.  By providing us with personal information, you consent to this transfer. Zaka will protect the privacy and security of personal information according to this Privacy Policy regardless of where the personal information is processed or stored.</li>

<li>20.    Retention period.  Zaka reserves the right to retain your personal information for a period of 7 years or more to satisfy legal requirements such as recordkeeping and tax and credit reporting requirements, as well as for purposes of fraud prevention, audit and data integrity. In addition, Zaka reserves the right to retain, as well as to use and disclose as permitted pursuant to this Privacy Policy, your personal information for such period of time as reasonably needed by Zaka to facilitate activities and transactions for the operation of the Website and Program, improve User experiences on the Website and in the Program and further Zaka’s mission. Zaka reserves the right to retain information that does not directly identify you, for example, aggregated or anonymized data.</li>

<li>21.    Modifications; Interpretation.  Zaka may update or modify this Privacy Policy from time to time.
